# FastApi Template for ML Projects


[![SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/images/project_badges/sonarcloud-dark.svg)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=ELC_fastapi-production-template)

This is a template that provides the minimal scaffolding to support ML projects
including CICD, deployment and multi-layered architecture.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repo.
1. Protect the default branch.
1. Install the UV package manager with `pip install uv==0.8.9`. Pipx can be used
as well
1. Install dependencies with `uv sync --all-groups`.

### Running tests

Tests can be run via the terminal or through the VS Code Testing Pane.

To run them from the terminal use this command:

```
uv run poe test
```

Check the coverage percentage, the CICD pipeline will fail if it is lower than
100%.

### Linters and formatters

There are multiple linters and formaters in this project.

To run them from the terminal use this command:

```
uv run poe format
```

### Serve the app

The app consists of two independent servers, one for the backend API and one for
the frontend. They can be executed independently or jointly. By using the
following commands:

Backend + Frontend:

```
uv run poe serve
```

Backend Only:

```
uv run poe serve-api
```

Frontend Only:

```
uv run poe serve-ui
```

### Deployment

Render.com is used as deployment platform, to ensure the deploy will be
successful. It is recommended to build and run docker locally when
troubleshooting issues.

Build the docker image with

```
uv run poe docker-build
```

Before running, ensure there is a `.env` with relevant environment variables
defined. Then, run the docker image with:

```
uv run poe docker-run
```

The deployment to render occurs on every commit to the default branch.

## Secundary tools and configurations you need to consider

* SonarQube: first register your project in SonarQube, if you don't have an 
account you can create one, and you should configure a webhook to trigger 
analysis on each push.
    * Review this documentation for more details: [SonarQube Documentation](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/)
    * Integrate with your Github CI/CD pipeline for automated quality checks.
        * It is imperative to configure this variables within Github Actions 
        secrets:
            * `SONAR_TOKEN` (this token you need to add it in Project - Settings -
                Security - Secrets and variables - Actions - New repository secret)
            * This token you can find it in your SonarQube account settings. For 
                this open SonarQube and go to My Account - Security - Generate 
                Tokens and create a new one.
            * Grab the SonarQube Key, you will need it later.
    * Within the SonarQube project from the left side click on Administration
        and then on Analysis Method. On the "Analysis Method" page, you will 
        find a toggle or checkbox labeled "SonarCloud Automatic Analysis" or 
        similar. Uncheck or toggle this option to disable automatic analysis for 
        the project.

* Wakatime: Wakatime is a tool that helps you track your coding activity. 
You can sign up for an account and get an API key, which you will need to 
configure in your development environment. This API Key will be used with the
VS Code extension you should install. When you install this extension it will 
request your API Key.

* Render: You will need to configure your Render account to work with the 
application. This includes setting up the necessary environment variables and 
deployment settings. For this project you need to create a new Web Service using 
the free tier.
    * Create some Actions Variables like for SonarQube:
        * `RENDER_SERVICE_ID` (this service id you need to add it to github 
            Actions: Project - Settings - Security - Secrets and variables - 
            Actions - New repository secret)
            This service id you can find it in your Render account. For this open
            your Render dashboard and navigate to the Service ID.
        * `RENDER_API_KEY` (this API key you need to add it to github Actions:  
            Project - Settings - Security - Secrets and variables - Actions - 
            New repository secret)
            This API key you can find it in your Render account. For this open
            your Render dashboard and navigate Account Settings and then search
            for API Keys. You will need to create a new key for this.
    * Auto-deploy disabled: go to you recent project created and select settings
        , then scroll down to Auto-Deploy option, edit it, and select Off.

* Github PAT: You will need a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) to authenticate 
with the Render. You can create a PAT by going to your GitHub account settings, 
then Developer settings, and finally Personal access tokens. Make sure to grant 
the necessary permissions, in this case Read and Write for Contributors.
    * Create an Actions Variable like for SonarQube:
        * `PUSH_TOKEN` (this PAT you need to add it to github Actions: Project - 
            Settings - Security - Secrets and variables - Actions - New 
            repository secret)
            This PAT is what you created in the previous step and will give you
            the necessary permissions to generate a new release version.

* Lint and Test hardcode values you need to change. You need to change two values:
    1. The `Dsonar.organization` in the `.github/workflows/lint_and_test.yml` 
    file. The value you need to change should have the GitHub organization you 
    have.
    2. The `Dsonar.projectKey` in the `.github/workflows/lint_and_test.yml` 
    file. This value should be composed by:
        * `<organization>_<repository>`

## Understanding data flow

The following sequence diagram shows the data flow in the application.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor u as User
    participant ui as Streamlit UI
    participant api as FastAPI Backend
    participant ts as Training Service
    participant ps as Prediction Service
    participant fs as File System

    Note over u,fs: Training Flow
    u   ->>  ui:  Wants to train a new model
    ui  ->>  api: /train
    api ->>  ts:  Invokes train with data
    activate ts 
    ts  -->> ts:  Trains model
    ts  ->>  fs:  Save Model
    fs  -->> ts: 
    ts  -->> api: 
    deactivate ts
    api -->> ui: 
    ui  -->> u: 

    Note over u,fs: Prediction Flow

    u   ->>  ui:  Wants a prediction
    ui  ->>  api: /predict
    api ->>  ps:  Invokes predict with data
    activate ps
    ps  ->>  fs:  Loads Model
    fs  -->> ps: 
    ps  -->> ps:  Generate Prediction
    ps  -->> api: 
    deactivate ps
    api -->> ui: 
    ui  -->> u: 
```

### CI/CD Flow

Below is an expanded sequence diagram illustrating the CI/CD flow implemented using GitHub Actions. It distinguishes between the workflows triggered by a Pull Request (PR) and those triggered by merging to the `master` branch:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor reviewer as Reviewer
    actor dev as Developer
    participant github as GitHub
    participant cicd as GitHub CICD Runner
    participant versioning as Versioning CICD Job
    participant lint as Linter CICD Job
    participant test as Test Runner CICD Job
    participant publish as Publish CICD Job
    participant deploy as Deploy CICD Job
    participant render as Render.com Service

    github-->>dev: 
    dev->>reviewer: Ask for next steps
    reviewer-->>dev: 
    dev->>dev: Works on a new feature
    dev->>github: Open PR
    github-->>dev: 

    loop Repeats for every commit
        dev->>github: Push changes 
        github->>cicd: Trigger
        activate cicd
        cicd->>versioning: Trigger

        deactivate cicd
        github-->>dev: 
        dev->>dev: Fix issues from CICD if any
    end

    loop Until all comments have been addressed
        dev->>reviewer: Notify after CICD passes
        reviewer->>github: Reviews PR and leaves comments
        github-->>reviewer: 
        reviewer-->>dev: Notify of comments
        dev->>dev: Adress Comments if any
        Note over dev, github: Above CICD process repeats
    end


    dev->>github: Merge PR to master
    github->>cicd: Trigger
    activate cicd
    cicd->>lint: Trigger
