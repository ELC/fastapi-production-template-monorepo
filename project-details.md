# Project Scoping Questions for ML Software Development

## 1. Problem Definition

### What real-world problem are you addressing, and why is it important?

### Who are the target users or stakeholders of your system?

### Is the problem supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, or a hybrid ML task? Choose one and explain

## 2. Data Considerations

### What kind of data will you use (structured, unstructured, multimodal)?

### Do you already have access to the data? (Yes/No) - If not, look for a dataset you have access to.

### Can the data be used openly in academic projects? (Yes/No) - If not, look for a different dataset.

### What is the expected size and quality of the dataset? Does the data require cleaning?

## 3. System Design & Software Architecture

### Which technology would you like to use for the different components of the ML Pipeline?

## 4. Model Development & Lifecycle

### Do you plan to build models from scratch or leverage pre-trained models?

### What criteria will you use to define model success beyond accuracy (e.g., fairness, latency, robustness)?

## 5. Testing & Quality Assurance

### How will you test your system end-to-end, especially around ML-specific challenges (e.g., non-determinism, drift)?

## 6. Deployment & Operations

### Will your system run in batch mode, real-time, or hybrid?

### How will you monitor the system for performance degradation and data drift?
